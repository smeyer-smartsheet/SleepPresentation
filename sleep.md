# Introduction
- **Why Sleep Matters**: Exploring the connection between sleep and mental wellness.

---

# Research
- **Getting More Sleep**
  - Studies have shown that sleep is inherently connected to improved studies and mental health for students.
    - [School Start Times](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/134/3/642/74175/School-Start-Times-for-Adolescents?autologincheck=redirected)
  - Insomnia in cognitively unimpaired adults at increased risk for AD is associated to poorer performance in some executive functions ...
    - [Insomnia <-> Cognitively Imparied Adults](https://alzres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13195-019-0547-3#:~:text=Insomnia%20in%20cognitively%20unimpaired%20adults,as%20decreased%20white%20matter%20diffusivity.)
  - "Among those with comorbid disorders, anxiety disorders preceded insomnia 73% of the time, while insomnia occurred first in 69% of comorbid insomnia and depression cases."

# Research (Blue lights are bad for you!!!!)

## **Circadian Ryhthyms**
One of the most notable studies was conducted by Charles A. Czeisler, a professor at Harvard Medical School, which explored how exposure to artificial light alters the human circadian rhythm.

---
## [Effect of Light on Human Circadian Physiology](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20161220/)

- Participants were exposed to artificially controlled lighting environments for an extended period.
- Researchers manipulated the light exposure to study how it affected the participants' internal body clocks, or circadian rhythms.
- Demonstrated that artificial light, **especially blue light commonly emitted by screens and modern lighting**, could significantly shift or disrupt the body's internal clock.

# Sleep Diary Exercise
- **Track Your Sleep**: For the next week, keep a daily log of your sleep patterns.
- **Parameters to Note**:
  - Total sleep hours.
  - Sleep quality (1-10 scale).
  - Wake-up mood.
  - Daytime alertness.

---

# Personal Story Sharing
- **Sharing Experiences**: Sharing personal stories about how sleep affects your mental health.
  - Sharing with others can reduce the stigma around sleep issues
  - Everyone always jokes about getting 'bad sleep', how many of us share how we have overcome it?
- **Learning from Each Other**: There are common themes and differences in our experiences with sleep.
  - Keep a sleep diary and share with each other how we have used it to adjust our behaviors and improve our sleep over time.
